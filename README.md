# Tic Tac Toe

A simple tic tac toe program to apply the lessons learned on [Factory Functions And The Module Pattern](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-factory-functions-and-the-module-pattern).

I won't be making this project pretty, I had in mind to make the minimax algorithm shows up like a table of moves where you could see visually how the AI decides its moves but I will discard that idea and I don't want to waste an entire week for every single project.
